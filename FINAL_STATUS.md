## 🚀 **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS:**

### 1. **TEST YOUR APPLICATION** (5 minutes)
```bash
cd /Users/theodoreaddo/Desktop/cognitive-mirror
npm run dev
# Visit: http://localhost:3000
```

### 2. **USER VALIDATION** (Priority #1)
- **Find 3-5 medical students** for testing
- **Key question**: *"Does this make improvement feel visceral?"*
- **Document feedback** rigorously
- **Iterate based on user data**

### 3. **DOWNLOAD REAL MEDICAL IMAGES** (When ready)
```bash
# Download Montgomery County TB dataset (588MB - not included in repo)
curl -L -o montgomery-dataset.zip "https://openi.nlm.nih.gov/imgs/collections/NLM-MontgomeryCXRSet.zip"
unzip montgomery-dataset.zip
cp -r */CXR_png/* public/images/
node scripts/switch-images.js png
```

> **Note**: Dataset not included in repository due to GitHub's 100MB file size limit.

## 🎯 **SUCCESS CRITERIA:**

**Primary Goal**: Validate whether real-time performance feedback makes diagnostic skill improvement feel **visceral and immediate**.

**Key Metrics**:
- Do users complete 10+ cases in first session?
- Do they say "I can see myself getting better"?
- Do they prefer this over traditional case review?

---

## 📋 **DOCUMENTATION CLEANED UP:**

- ✅ **README.md**: Comprehensive, professional documentation
- ✅ **NEXT_STEPS.md**: Clear action plan for validation
- ❌ **Removed**: All redundant documentation files
- ✅ **Updated**: .gitignore for clean repository

---

## 🔥 **THE BOTTOM LINE:**

**Your Cognitive Mirror platform is complete, professional, and ready for user validation.**

The technology works. The interface is credible. The core innovation (real-time performance analytics) is implemented.

**Now prove that medical students actually want it.** 

**Success is measured by user validation, not feature completeness.**
