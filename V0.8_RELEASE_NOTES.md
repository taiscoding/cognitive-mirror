## 💬 Key Interview Talking Points

### What Makes This Special
> "Most radiology platforms are static case libraries. Pixel to Practice uniquely combines real-time performance analytics with an adaptive learning engine that personalizes your learning path. It's like having a personal tutor that quantifies your improvement."

### The Innovation
> "The key innovation is making improvement visceral. You don't just review cases—you watch yourself get measurably better. The adaptive engine adjusts difficulty based on your performance, keeping you in the optimal learning zone."

### Technical Depth
> "Built with Next.js 14 and React, using custom algorithms for performance tracking including F1 score calculations with spatial tolerance. The adaptive recommendation system analyzes your last 5 cases to suggest optimal next steps. All deployed on Vercel with CI/CD from GitHub."

### Impact
> "This solves a fundamental problem in medical education: the lack of objective feedback. Radiology residency is 4 years of pattern recognition training. This tool makes that training quantifiable, trackable, and optimizable."
